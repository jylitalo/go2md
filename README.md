# go2md
Create markdown documentation from golang code.

This project was inspired by [github.com/davecheney/godoc2md](https://github.com/davecheney/godoc2md), but why I wanted to build it without dependency to golang.org/x/tools v0.0.0-20181011021141-0e57ebad1d6b

Main target audience is private golang projects or anyone, who wants to keep documentation in git repo as files.
